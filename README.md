# Custom blocklist for Adguard Home and Sophos XG

Script.sh loads the following lists:
- Hagezi's Ultimate https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists
and removes the domains of the following lists:
- https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/blob/main/share/microsoft.txt
- ATR_White_List.txt
- White_List.txt
This new list is saved as Merged.txt which my Sophos XG is loading and using in Active Thread Response as thread list.

White list.txt is also my white list for my personal Adguard Home instance.
